# Planning the Growth of the Decision Tree Logic

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for growing the decision tree logic of the Defi Oracle Meta Deployer project, especially when errors occur during deployments or specific configurations are required.

## Technical Requirements

1. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Implement detailed error handling for each decision point.
   - Provide clear error messages and recovery options.
   - Log errors for further analysis and debugging.

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Allow users to specify custom configurations for deployments.
   - Validate configurations before applying them.
   - Provide default configurations for common use cases.

3. **Decision Points Expansion**
   - Expand decision points to cover more scenarios and edge cases.
   - Allow users to add custom decision points and actions.

4. **Interactive User Interface**
   - Enhance the web interface to support dynamic decision tree visualization.
   - Allow users to interact with the decision tree and make changes in real-time.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Identify common errors and failure points in the current decision tree.
   - Implement error handling and logging for these points.
   - Provide recovery options and clear error messages.

2. **Phase 2: Configuration Management**
   - Implement a configuration management system to handle custom configurations.
   - Validate configurations before applying them to deployments.
   - Provide default configurations for common use cases.

3. **Phase 3: Decision Points Expansion**
   - Expand the decision tree to cover more scenarios and edge cases.
   - Allow users to add custom decision points and actions.

4. **Phase 4: Interactive User Interface**
   - Enhance the web interface to support dynamic decision tree visualization.
   - Allow users to interact with the decision tree and make changes in real-time.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Monitoring and Alerts**
   - Integrate advanced monitoring and alerting for deployments.
   - Provide real-time feedback and notifications for errors and issues.

2. **Machine Learning Integration**
   - Use machine learning to predict and prevent common errors.
   - Provide recommendations for optimal configurations and actions.
